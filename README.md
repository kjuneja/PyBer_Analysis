# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Purpose of this project was to use python skills and knowledge of Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. THen, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city types. In last we will submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

This project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present our results. We will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
* Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

### Results

The following Table shows the Ride-Sharing Summary DataFrame by city type

From the above summary data frame, we can notice the trend between the types of cities for the number of rides. Urban cities are more polular and take more rides. We can also notice that Total Rides is directly proportional to the Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Rider and Average Fare per Driver. As there is a increase in Total Riders, there is an increase in the total drivers and so on. Rural cities have less riders and we can see that in rural areas average fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher as the supply is low. 

In the below line chart we can see the trend of Total Fare by city in a course of 5 months. This chart will help us to understand that in which month there is higher rate of riders. We can see that the number of rides seem peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of march. We can also notice that In the month of April Suburban has sharper increase in the number of rides as compared to Rural and Urban cities.

### Summary 

As per the line chart as reference we can summarize the following recommendations to the CEO of PyBer

* In the Suburban Cities the toal fare sky rocketed in the month of April and the other city type were just constant, the company should investigate why in suburban city there is a increase in April. 
* The average fare per ride and average fare per rider is higher when there are less drivers, with this data the company can increase the number of drivers during a certain time to get great profits. 
* The number of riders and drivers are very low in suburban areas, as there is less demand the supply is also. limited. The company should try to find a way to get more riders in suburban areas and also allocate more drivers as the riders increases. 

These information might be very helpful to the company and making these changes would really impact the growth of the company.
